# Weed_Detection_Control_Module
- Controling Module for the motors in the Weed_detection project using AVR Microcontroller.

- LCD driver Used to indicate which motor is on.

- Uart driver is used to communicate between the mosule used in the Camera for weed_detection and the control module for the motors using AVR microcontroller.

- That's Link for the simulation of the Project : https://youtu.be/_59PZ7vzVJg
